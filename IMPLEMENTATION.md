# Implementation Plan

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the "La Bonne Sante" Flutter application.

## Journal

This section will be updated after each phase to log actions taken, things learned, surprises, and deviations from the plan.

*   **Phase 1 (Current):** Project setup and initialization.

## Phase 1: Project Setup

- [ ] Create a Flutter package in the current directory.
- [ ] Remove any boilerplate in the new package that will be replaced, including the `test` dir.
- [ ] Update the description of the package in `pubspec.yaml` and set the version number to `0.1.0`.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` to include a short placeholder description of the package.
- [ ] Create the `CHANGELOG.md` to have the initial version of `0.1.0`.
- [ ] Commit this empty version of the package to the `main` branch.
- [ ] After committing the change, start running the app on the user's preferred device.

After completing a task, if you added any TODOs to the code or didn't fully implement anything, make sure to add new tasks so that you can come back and complete them later.

## Phase 2: Core and Data Layer Setup

- [ ] Create the directory structure for the `core` and `data` layers.
- [ ] Add dependencies: `riverpod`, `flutter_riverpod`, `drift`, `sqlite3_flutter_libs`, `path_provider`, `path`, `dio`, `freezed`, `json_serializable`, `build_runner`.
- [ ] Set up the Drift database, including the `Product` table with `TypeConverter` for lists.
- [ ] Implement the Dio client for network requests.
- [ ] Create the data models and implement the remote and local data sources.
- [ ] Implement the `ProductRepository` in the data layer.

After this phase, you should:

- [ ] Create/modify unit tests for testing the code added or modified in this phase, if relevant.
- [ ] Run the `dart_fix` tool to clean up the code.
- [ ] Run the `analyze_files` tool one more time and fix any issues.
- [ ] Run any tests to make sure they all pass.
- [ ] Run `dart_format` to make sure that the formatting is correct.
- [ ] Re-read the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file to see what, if anything, has changed in the implementation plan, and if it has changed, take care of anything the changes imply.
- [ ] Update the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file with the current state, including any learnings, surprises, or deviations in the Journal section. Check off any checkboxes of items that have been completed.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify the changes that have been made, and create a suitable commit message for any changes, following any guidelines you have about commit messages. Be sure to properly escape dollar signs and backticks, and present the change message to the user for approval.
- [ ] Wait for approval. Don't commit the changes or move on to the next phase of implementation until the user approves the commit.
- [ ] After committing the change, if the app is running, use the `hot_reload` tool to reload it.

## Phase 3: Domain and Presentation Layer (Home Page)

- [ ] Create the directory structure for the `domain` and `presentation` layers.
- [ ] Implement the domain layer, including entities, repository interfaces, and use cases.
- [ ] Implement the Riverpod providers for the home page.
- [ ] Build the UI for the home page, including the promo banner, categories, and product sections.

After this phase, you should:

- [ ] Create/modify unit tests for testing the code added or modified in this phase, if relevant.
- [ ] Run the `dart_fix` tool to clean up the code.
- [ ] Run the `analyze_files` tool one more time and fix any issues.
- [ ] Run any tests to make sure they all pass.
- [ ] Run `dart_format` to make sure that the formatting is correct.
- [ ] Re-read the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file to see what, if anything, has changed in the implementation plan, and if it has changed, take care of anything the changes imply.
- [ ] Update the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file with the current state, including any learnings, surprises, or deviations in the Journal section. Check off any checkboxes of items that have been completed.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify the changes that have been made, and create a suitable commit message for any changes, following any guidelines you have about commit messages. Be sure to properly escape dollar signs and backticks, and present the change message to the user for approval.
- [ ] Wait for approval. Don't commit the changes or move on to the next phase of implementation until the user approves the commit.
- [ ] After committing the change, if the app is running, use the `hot_reload` tool to reload it.

## Phase 4: Product Detail Page

- [ ] Implement the Riverpod providers for the product detail page.
- [ ] Build the UI for the product detail page, including all the specified elements.

After this phase, you should:

- [ ] Create/modify unit tests for testing the code added or modified in this phase, if relevant.
- [ ] Run the `dart_fix` tool to clean up the code.
- [ ] Run the `analyze_files` tool one more time and fix any issues.
- [ ] Run any tests to make sure they all pass.
- [ ] Run `dart_format` to make sure that the formatting is correct.
- [ ] Re-read the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file to see what, if anything, has changed in the implementation plan, and if it has changed, take care of anything the changes imply.
- [ ] Update the `IMPLEMENTATION.md` file with the current state, including any learnings, surprises, or deviations in the Journal section. Check off any checkboxes of items that have been completed.
- [ ] Use `git diff` to verify the changes that have been made, and create a suitable commit message for any changes, following any guidelines you have about commit messages. Be sure to properly escape dollar signs and backticks, and present the change message to the user for approval.
- [ ] Wait for approval. Don't commit the changes or move on to the next phase of implementation until the user approves the commit.
- [ ] After committing the change, if the app is running, use the `hot_reload` tool to reload it.

## Phase 5: Finalization

- [ ] Create a comprehensive `README.md` file for the package.
- [ ] Create a `GEMINI.md` file in the project directory that describes the app, its purpose, and implementation details of the application and the layout of the files.
- [ ] Ask the user to inspect the app and the code and say if they are satisfied with it, or if any modifications are needed.
